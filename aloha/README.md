This codebase is forked from the [Mobile ALOHA repo](https://github.com/MarkFzp/mobile-aloha), and contains teleoperation and dataset collection and evaluation tools for the Stationary and Mobile ALOHA kits available from Trossen Robotics.

To get started with your ALOHA kit, follow the [ALOHA Getting Started Documentation](https://docs.trossenrobotics.com/aloha_docs/getting_started.html).

To train imitation learning algorithms, you would also need to install:

* [ACT for Stationary ALOHA](https://github.com/Interbotix/act).
* [ACT++ for Mobile ALOHA](https://github.com/Interbotix/act-plus-plus)
